# TeamCity Build Opentelemetry Exporter Plugin

A custom TeamCity plugin that registers a build listener to send build trace data to an opentelemetry collector external endpoint.

## What is OpenTelemetry

You can use OpenTelemetry to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for analysis in order to understand your software's performance and behavior. Create and collect telemetry data from your services and software, then forward them to a variety of analysis tools. For more information about OpenTelemetry go to https://opentelemetry.io/. Documentation for instrumentation for Java and other languages can be found [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/).
